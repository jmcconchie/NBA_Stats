# NBA Stats
 
## Overview
NBA Stats is a project I created with the goal of using the newest versions of several different tools that I am already familiar with. This project uses:
* .NET 6
* D3.js v6
* Bootstrap v5
* SweetAlert2
* Select2

All the stats and information come from the [balldontlie API.](https://www.balldontlie.io/)

A live version of the project can be found at https://nba-stats-n-stuff.herokuapp.com/

## Pages

### Search Players
Search for any NBA player and select a season to find season averages of points, rebounds, assists, and other stats. Also includes a D3.js visualization showing the height of the player (if available).

### Compare Players
Select 2-5 players to compare season averages for stats. Uses D3.js to create horizontal bar charts comparing each stat category.
