# NBA Stats
 
NBA Stats is a project I created with the goal of using the newest versions of several different tools that I am already familiar with. This project uses:
* .NET 6
* D3.js v6
* Bootstrap v5
* SweetAlert2
* Select2

All the stats and information come from the [balldontlie API](https://www.balldontlie.io/)
